## Reading from Serial

## Multiplexing

The idea of multiplexing is to send voltage to only a row of LEDs at any given time so that we are able to keep with a great degree of light without needing a power providing. By flashing more than one row faster than what our eyes are able to interpret we are able then to draw any shape, which is what we want.
